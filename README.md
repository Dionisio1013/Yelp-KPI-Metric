# Yelp KPI Web Application & Sentiment Analysis

Here is a link to my [web application!](https://dionisio1013-hope-test-bdpevq.streamlit.app/)
This project is a part of the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
Yelp is a crowd-source app that allows users to critique restaurants by providing
a star rating from 1-5 and a message augmenting their reasons. It acts as a way for 
restaurants to market their popularity, have business-customer interaction, set standards expectations
and to able to lean from customer criticism. 

Goals of project
1) Dissect why certain restaurants have certain ratings whether it 
be food, ambiance, how it makes the customer feel, what it dislikes. 
2) The goal is to 
use natural language processors as a way to make predictions on why some ratings score 
higher than others. We want to learn from unhappy customers. At the end I will develop a KPI 
that will allow stakeholders to store restaurant data and 
3) Develop a web application for stakeholders to use to pursue data driven decision making from my findings
